ASDF-ENCODINGS

This library allows you to use ASDF with Lisp source files
that use an encoding different from either ASCII or UTF-8.
It depends on ASDF 2.21 or later (actually 2.20.7 or later)

TODO:
(1) actually support more than utf-8, latin1 and default.
(2) Add a test suite.
(3) test it on more than sbcl, ccl, clisp.


==== Exported Functionality ====

The asdf-encodings defines a package ASDF-ENCODINGS.
It uses ASDF 2.21's asdf:*encoding-external-format-hook*
to define a simple mapping from encodings specified as portable keywords
to implementation-defined external formats.
It issues warnings or errors when no matching external-format is available,
depending on asdf-encodings.


ENCODING-EXTERNAL-FORMAT (ENCODING)
  This function takes a keyword which is one of
  :default
  :utf-8 :utf8
  :latin1 :latin-1 :iso-8859-1
  and returns a value suitable for use as :external-format argument to
  the current implementation's CL:OPEN, CL:LOAD or CL:COMPILE-FILE functions.
